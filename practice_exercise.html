    The New Queen of Daytime Talk

  <p>
    John William Oliver was born in Erdington, West Midlands, England. He got into the theatre scene early and began his career as a stand up comedian in England. However his most recognizable roles began with being the head British correspondant on Jon Stewart's "The Daily Show." Eventually he moved up to co host of the same show, and currently hosts his own show on HBO called Last Week Tonight.

    Approach to Comedy
  </h2>
  <div class="section-1">
    Oliver mainly focuses on political satire based comedy, using ongoing current events as a platform to make jokes while also using humor to unravel complex political concepts and events and re-weaving them into terms that people who are not at all involved in the technicalities and complexities of politics can understand. Oliver also engages in self depreciating comedy, sometimes describing himself as the following:
    <ul>
      <li>A near sighted parrot who works at a bank</li>
      <li>An owl who got stood up at the prom</li>
      <li>A man who lives alone surrounded by jars that hes too weak to open by himself</li>
      <li>etc...</li>
    </ul>
    While all of these self applied monikers are funny and somewhat absurd, Oliver is actually a highly educated and well informed public figure. While not at all keeping his own views on political issues a secret, he still manages to present stories in a way that doesn't seem totally politically biased. He will present some information empirically, but will then use comedy to draw attention to the flaws in logic or execution of political decisions or policies. Some of the issues he has tackled are as follows:
    <ol>
      <li>Big Pharma</li>
      <li>Big Tobacco</li>
      <li>Gerrymandering</li>
      <li>Special Districts</li>
      <li>Foreign Elections</li>
      <li>Brexit</li>
      <li>Trump/Clinton Conspiracies</li>
      <li>Stupid Watergate</li>
    </ol>
